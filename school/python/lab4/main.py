    This project serves several functions as listed below:
"""
# TODO: finish main desc
import something


def main_menu_loop():  #
    """provides menu loop functionality so the program continuously returns here after operation.
    input options are printed, option chosen is accepted then run through validation, then gets
    passed to the match-case

# part 1
# enter and validate phone number and zip+4.
# user enters values of two 3x3 matrices
# select from options including addition, subtraction, matrix multiplication, and
#     element by element multiplication
#     should use numpy.matmul() for matrix multiplication (e.g. np.matmul(a, b) )
# program should:
#   compute the appropriate results
#   return the results and the transpose of the results, the mean of the rows for the results,
#       and the mean of the columns for the results
# steps
#   make skeletons for modules
#   make skeletons for functions
#   work on functions seperately
