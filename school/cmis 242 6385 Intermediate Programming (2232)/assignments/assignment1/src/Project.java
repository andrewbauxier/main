    // A private class method named findMinimum with a return type of Weight. This method
    // should accept three Weight objects as parameters and compare each Weight object’s
    // weight values to find the minimum. The Weight object with the minimum weight value
    // should be returned and then printed using toString in the following format:
    // The minimum weight is x pounds and y ounces
    // where x is the number of pounds and y the number of ounces. Ounces should be
    // displayed with two decimal places.

    // A private class method named findMaximum with a return type of Weight. This method
    // should accept three Weight objects as parameters and compare each Weight object’s weight
    // values to find the maximum. The Weight object with the maximum weight value should be
    // returned and then printed using toString in the following format:
    // The maximum weight is x pounds and y ounceswhere x is the number of pounds and y the number of ounces. Ounces should be
    // displayed with two decimal places.

    // A private class method named findAverage with a return type of Weight. This method
    // should accept three Weight objects as parameters and calculate the average weight value. A new
    // Weight object with the average weight values should be returned and then printed using toString
    // in the following format:
    // The average weight is x pounds and y ounces
    // where x is the number of pounds and y the number of ounces. Ounces should be
    // displayed with two decimal places.
    
    // A public method named main with a return type of void. This method should exercise the
    // correct functionality of findMinimum, findMaximum and findAverage by creating three
    // Weight objects using the hardcoded values below:
    // Weight weight1 = new Weight(11, 3);
    // Weight weight2 = new Weight(7, 20); // Hint: normalize method should be
    // used to translate into 8 pounds and 4 ounces
    // Weight weight3 = new Weight(14, 6);
    
    //end methods
